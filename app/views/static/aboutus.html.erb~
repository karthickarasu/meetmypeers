<p>Then look at the following "guaranteed right of criminal defendants."</p>

 <p>   "jury of one's peers" n.</p>

    <p> a guaranteed right of criminal defendants, in which "peer" means an "equal." This has been interpreted by courts to mean that the available jurors include a broad spectrum of the population, particularly of race, national origin and gender. Jury selection may include no process which excludes those of a particular race or intentionally narrows the spectrum of possible jurors. It does not mean that women are to be tried by women, Asians by Asians, or African Americans by African Americans.

So, how would you feel if you or a loved one, perhaps not too bright or able in some respect, was to go before a jury of their peers, which, by the rule of equal, would also have to be not too bright or able? Personally, in such a case I'd opt for a jury brighter and more able than myself; but, this would seemingly violate the guarantee.

This raises the question of how just is this guarantee? Wouldn't it be far fairer to have the best jurists possible: the brightest and best legally informed? Perhaps, even professional jurists?

To me, the concept of "jury by one's peers" is seriously flawed, and has only stuck around because it sounds good rather than insuring any kind of best justice.

So, should we, keep "a jury of one's peers"? Fix it? Or come up with some other judicial solution?

I would want a jury of my peers, but unfortunately I would never get one. I would never want a religious person on my jury, for I am an atheist for a reason - I do not think that adults should adhere to magical thinking. As a matter of fact, I find it dangerous to have somebody deciding my fate who also believes in an invisible man in the sky creating us instead of what the evidence shows, since my case would be based upon the evidence.

Moreover, I also am intelligent (objectively) with an IQ well above 140. I doubt anybody on my jury would touch that due to the law of averages. I am not saying that is necessary to be my peer, but I would certainly hope that the jurors would be of above average intelligence at least since most lawyers are, and therefore my jurors would need to be to understand the lawyers case and my testimony.
